## üéØ What This Delivers

A serverless security platform that continuously monitors multi-cloud environments and automatically maps findings to regulatory frameworks.

**Designed for:**
- **Compliance teams** preparing for SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, or NIST assessments
- **Organizations** needing continuous security monitoring with audit-ready evidence
- **MSPs/MSSPs** managing security and compliance for multiple clients
- **Security teams** requiring centralized visibility across AWS, Azure, GCP, and SaaS platforms

**Key capabilities:**
- Automated security finding aggregation across cloud providers
- Compliance framework mapping (ISO 27001, SOC 2, NIST 800-53, HIPAA)
- Continuous evidence collection and retention
- CloudWatch dashboards and alerting
- Customer-retained data (no vendor lock-in)

## üèóÔ∏è Platform Architecture

### Multi-Cloud Security Monitoring

VistaSec/CMC provides centralized visibility across:

| Environment | Monitoring Capabilities |
|-------------|------------------------|
| **AWS** | Security Hub findings, Config compliance, GuardDuty threats, IAM analysis, S3 exposure, EC2 security groups |
| **Azure** | Security Center recommendations, Secure Score tracking, Defender findings |
| **GCP** | Security Command Center findings, asset inventory, policy violations |
| **GitHub** | Dependabot vulnerabilities, secret scanning alerts, repository security |
| **GitLab** | Project vulnerabilities, dependency scanning results |
| **Notion** | User access auditing, public page detection, data exposure risks |
| **Infrastructure** | TLS certificate monitoring, endpoint health checks, availability tracking |

### Serverless Event-Driven Design
```
Scheduled Events (CloudWatch Events)
         ‚Üì
Multi-Cloud Scanners (AWS Lambda)
         ‚Üì
Centralized Storage (DynamoDB)
         ‚Üì
Compliance Calculator (Lambda)
         ‚Üì
Dashboards & Evidence Exports (CloudWatch + S3)
```

**Infrastructure Efficiency:**
- Runs on AWS Free Tier for typical monitoring workloads
- Production deployments typically cost $5-50/month in AWS infrastructure
- Serverless architecture scales automatically with findings volume
- No dedicated servers or ongoing maintenance overhead

## üìä Compliance Framework Coverage

VistaSec/CMC automatically maps security findings to compliance controls:

**ISO 27001 Coverage:**
- A.9 (Access Control): IAM policies, MFA enforcement, privileged access
- A.12 (Operations Security): Logging, monitoring, change management
- A.13 (Communications Security): Network controls, encryption, segmentation
- A.14 (System Acquisition): Secure development, security in projects

**SOC 2 Trust Services:**
- CC6.1: Logical and physical access controls
- CC6.6: Restricts access to sensitive data  
- CC7.2: System monitoring
- CC7.4: Security incident detection and response

**NIST 800-53 (Rev 5):**
- AC Family: Access Control
- AU Family: Audit and Accountability
- CM Family: Configuration Management
- IA Family: Identification and Authentication
- SC Family: System and Communications Protection

**HIPAA Security Rule:**
- ¬ß164.308(a)(1)(ii)(D): Information system activity review
- ¬ß164.308(a)(5)(ii)(C): Log-in monitoring
- ¬ß164.312(b): Audit controls
- ¬ß164.312(c)(2): Mechanism to authenticate ePHI

## üîí Customer-Tenant-First Architecture

Unlike traditional SaaS monitoring platforms that require sending your security data to third-party systems:

**All evidence stays in your AWS account:**
- Security findings stored in your DynamoDB tables
- Logs retained in your S3 buckets with your encryption
- CloudWatch dashboards visible in your console
- Complete data sovereignty and control

**FEDLIN deployment approach:**
- Infrastructure deployed via Terraform in your AWS account
- GitHub Actions with OIDC (no long-lived credentials)
- One-time setup, customer maintains ongoing access
- Can be removed cleanly with no vendor dependencies

**Benefits for regulated environments:**
- Satisfies data residency requirements
- Simplifies vendor risk assessments
- Supports SOC 2 / ISO 27001 / HIPAA / NIST evidence expectations
- No ongoing data processing agreements beyond initial deployment
